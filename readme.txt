== Installation ==

Installing "MailPoet WooCommerce Add-on" can be done either by searching for "MailPoet WooCommerce Add-on" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
2. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Setting up the Plugin =

To setup this plugin, go to "WooCommerce -> Settings" and then the MailPoet tab. The settings are in two sections. 'General | Available Lists'

"General" contains the main settings for the plugin.

"Available Lists" contains a table listing of all your created lists. Select the lists you want your customers to subscribe to by ticking the checkbox next to the list and press 'Save changes'.

That's it, now when your customers tick the subscribe checkbox on the checkout page, they will be subscribed to the newsletter/s you selected when processing an order.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
